Imagine IKEA. But in Minecraft.

<h3>
From the creators of Chipped, we now present the first release of Handcrafted! A mod to make your house into your home! :D
This is a major rework, so please notify us about any problems you might find while using the mod.
</h3>
 <h3>
Are you looking for a fantasy, steampunk or medieval feel? Or do you want to stick to a more vanilla decor?
Look no further! We've created over 250 furniture pieces for you to choose from. Be it chairs, tables, benches or desks; we got it all packaged neatly into a single mod.
</h3>
<h3>
This mod will provide all the furniture you could ever need to make your blocky house a home!
